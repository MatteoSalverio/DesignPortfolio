<h1>Matteo Salverio's Design Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Mateo Salverio, and my website is called troubleshoot.it. It is a website and service where I will take people’s technology-related issues and fix them. Then the solution will be reported to a website for all to see. I don’t believe that this will be a permanent job for me, but it will be a good experience.
	I am creating this portfolio with the hope that I can look back on this for inspiration in the future, and maybe even use these assets directly in the future. This project has been helpful to me in that I can figure out a general idea of what I want my career to be when I am older.
	My design for all the different projects in this portfolio is that I am trying to give it a technological feel to it, because it is a technology-based company. I have been using blue and green a lot, because I like them as colors, and a lot of technology like motherboards are green or blue. I want to keep my design simple, because the people seeing it are the ones who need help, and they likely are not that advanced with technology, so I would not like to overwhelm them with pictures, videos, crazy fonts, and other things like that.
	As I did all these projects, I learned about what I want to be, and how I want to get there. I have figured out what designs I like, and what I don’t like. This is all helpful for me to get what I want when thee time comes to do all of this in the real world. I will be able to find exactly what I want, and I will know exactly how to get there. I won’t have to waste my time talking to other designers or doing research.
