<h1>Matteo Salverio's Design Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Mateo Salverio, and my website is called troubleshoot.it. It is a website and service where I will take people’s technology-related issues and fix them. Then the solution will be reported to a website for all to see. I don’t believe that this will be a permanent job for me, but it will be a good experience.
	I am creating this portfolio with the hope that I can look back on this for inspiration in the future, and maybe even use these assets directly in the future. This project has been helpful to me in that I can figure out a general idea of what I want my career to be when I am older.
	My design for all the different projects in this portfolio is that I am trying to give it a technological feel to it, because it is a technology-based company. I have been using blue and green a lot, because I like them as colors, and a lot of technology like motherboards are green or blue. I want to keep my design simple, because the people seeing it are the ones who need help, and they likely are not that advanced with technology, so I would not like to overwhelm them with pictures, videos, crazy fonts, and other things like that.
	As I did all these projects, I learned about what I want to be, and how I want to get there. I have figured out what designs I like, and what I don’t like. This is all helpful for me to get what I want when thee time comes to do all of this in the real world. I will be able to find exactly what I want, and I will know exactly how to get there. I won’t have to waste my time talking to other designers or doing research.

<h2>Business Logo</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/MatteoSalverio/DesignPortfolio/blob/gh-pages/photos/Logo.png?raw=true" width="200" height="200" align="center" alt="Business Logo" class="picture">
<p>This logo is for my website troubleshoot.it. It is designed to resemble a simple computer processor. I designed it using a simple gree background, then I found a circuit design on the internet that I liked, and made it transparent, so that it could become a pattern, I then put it on the logo. I added a box shape on the top layer, and gave it a drop shadow effect, to create depth. Finally, I gave the whole thing an outline with the stroke effect.</p>
<h2>Business Letterhead</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/MatteoSalverio/DesignPortfolio/blob/gh-pages/photos/Letterhead.png?raw=true" height="400" align="center" alt="Business Letterhead" class="picture">
<p>This business letterhead was designed with simplicity in mind. I wanted the logo, website name, and contact info to be there. I also designed it with a lot of empty space in mind, because you need plenty of room to write a business letter.</p>

<h2>Business Card</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/MatteoSalverio/DesignPortfolio/blob/gh-pages/photos/Business%20Card.png?raw=true" width="350" align="center" alt="Business Card" class="picture">
<p>This business card was designed in a very similar way to the letterhead. I didn't want it to be confusing to anyone. I wanted a decent amount of blank space, with enough information to get a customer to where they need to be.</p>

<h2>Business Advertisement</h2>
<img src="" width="400" class="picture">
<p>This advertisement is made to resemble one of the most common computer errors, the "Blue Screen of Death" on Windows 10. This makes the ad relatable, and easily demonstrates what the website is for.</p>
